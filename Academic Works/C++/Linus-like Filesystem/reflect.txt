I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete 
my workshops and assignments.

-Why do you need to deallocate the dynamically allocated memory in your vector of resources?
->When a directory is removed, any resources it holds sholud be cleaned up to avoid memory leaks. Because
Resources in the vector are dynamically allocated objects, the memory allocated for these resources remains
in use without deallocation.

-To call specific functions for a Directory objects stored in a Resource*, what special C++ operation did you have to do and why?
->I used dynamic_cast<Directory*> when I had to point to an specific address of a directory that was already created.
some lines in my code: 
Resource* found = m_current->find(dirName);
m_current = dynamic_cast<Directory*>(found);

Because find(dirName) returns Resource* type, found has the same type with the address returned. And m_current is Directory*
type so, 'found' must be polymorphed to Directory* to match to type of m_current.

dynamic_cast also were used in the find() function.
some lines in my code: 
if (m_contents[i]->type() == NodeType::DIR) {
	return dynamic_cast<Directory*>(m_contents[i])->find(name, opflags);
}
Before calling the function recursively in the function, the type of m_contents[i] is Resource*. To call find() of Directory class in 
m_contents[i] object, the type must be changed to Directory*.

-In this workshop you had to use std::vector<sdds::Resource*> to store a collection of filesystem resources as pointers. 
Could you have used std::vector<sdds::Resource> instead? 
Justify your answer!
->It is not a good way because the type in the vector must polymorph itself due to the two derived classes inherited the Resource class.
If std::vector <sdds::Resource> is used, the polymorphism is not available so you can only use the members of Resource and would not 
know if a resource in the vector is File type or Directory type.
