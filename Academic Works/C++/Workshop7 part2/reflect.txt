I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I recapped how to make a derived class to inherit a base class.
I designed Truck class which inherits from the MotorVehicle base class. The Truck
class inherits member variables and member functions of MotorVehicle class, allowing
Truck class accesses to MotorVehicle class.
In terms of Shadowing, I have shadowed the 'write' and 'read' member function of
MotorVehicle class. It allows me to create 'write' and 'read' function in Truck class.
The reason I can access to the shadowed member functions is scope resolution operator
'::'. It allows me to use the shadowed functions defined in a base class in a function in
derived class.
Insertion and extraction operators were defined by calling 'read' and 'write' in both classes.
Overloading these operators gives me intuitive insight about the both functions. They
reinforce reusability and efficiency.
Overall, this workshop has given me a good understanding of inheritance, function shadowing,
and input/output operators. What I learned is how to design and implement class inheritance,
keep access to members of base class in derived class. By the learning, I got understood hierarchies
applied to object-oriented programming.
