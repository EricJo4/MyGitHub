I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that 
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In workshop 9, I learned how to apply Rule of Three when Derived classes
are created. I applied this rule by calling the base class's rule of three to that
of the derived class, HtmlText. By understanding this significance of copy
constructors, copy assignment operators, and destructors. Except for the destructor,
I successfully allocated dynamic memory and delete it to prevent memory leaks.
I practiced implementing those to improve my coding skills.
HtmlText class inherited Text class so, it also had a virtual function named write.
The write function overrided the version in the base class as the compiler extended
its functionality by the 'virtual keyword. 
Operator[] was used as operator overloading. The index operator in the Text class allowed
me to provide read-only access to the content of the text file. It has shown how to create
a behaviour for a specific operator.
Overall, I learned how to apply Rule of Three to Polymorphism, Dynamic Dispatch
for new version of functions, and index operator.
