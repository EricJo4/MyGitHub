I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete 
my workshops and assignments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Q. Why the definitions and implementations in this case should be included in header file? Are there ways 
to work around and include implementation in .cpp files?
Unlike the common classes, template classes should have instantiation of arguments. The compiler doesn't
know how to compile the template classes until it finds specific instantitions of a template class which has
been implemented.

-Q. Explain why it was necessary for you to add the members that you added into the Book class.
I added operator< and operator> besides the constructors, and print(). Those operators were needed when
setSmallestItem() and setLargestItem() in Collection class. Unlike instantiated types, double, and int, Book class
has no pre-defined binary operator to know the relationship. For this reason, I added them and created the functions
in the Collection class work for the Book class too.

-Q. explain why these functions cannot be querries, even though they do not change value.
getSmallestItem() and getLargestItem() returns the values iterated over the collection. 
discuss if we can make this function a query or not (do an experiment and discuss your results).

-Q. What is the reason for defining the class objects outside the class definition?
Operator[]() returns elements of the collection that are allowed to be modified. That's why it should not return const
reference.

-Q.What is the reason for specializing the definition of m_smallestItem and m_largestItem objects for Book and 10.
As I commented on the first question, template classes must have instantiations in the header file. int and double types
that were used in this session don't need the specialization while the Book class does. Unlike those primitive types,
specialization is essential for the class using constructors. The number 10 determines the capacity of the array, m_items.

-Q. m_smallestItem and m_largestItem objects are also initialized for Book and 72. Is this initilization necessary? Why?
Yes.Tthe main module of part2 has the new object which has 72 capacity. The instantiation of Book and 72 is essential
to make the compiler understand the usage of the template class.
