I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor 
provided to complete my workshops and assignments.
===========================================================
In this workshop I had chances to practice defining and creating copy constructors and copy
assignment. There are TextFile(const TextFile&) which is the copy constructor and TextFile&
operator=(const TextFile&) which is the copy assignment. I got a deeper understanding about
the differenc of those two. The former is copying the existing resources to new object while
the latter to existing object.
To prevent copying and assignment, we can use 'delete' at the end of functions we want to prevent.
In this workshop, 'Line(const Line&) = delete' and 'Line& operator=(const Line&) = delete' are the
examples of prevention.
Interesting things are insertion and extraction operators. '<<', and '>>' operators for the TextFile class
enables programmers to print objects and read input easily.
ifstream and ofstream allowed me to read and from and write to text files. Through creating objects with
those operations, the client code can view the contents of the text file and save as other filename.
At last, I could read lines of a text file with ifstream using 'std::getline'. It is useful when handling text files.
Overall, I learned how to handle file using ifstream, and ofstream and additional class design such as 
copy constructors and copy assignment.
