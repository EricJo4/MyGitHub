I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete 
my workshops and assignments.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In workshop 1, I manipulated main funciton to receive program arguments from the command line by
changing Command Arguments on the property page of the project. Usually, main function is used without
any arguments like 'int main()' but I used int main(int argc, char* argv[]) to receive the number of command
lines and filenames saved in the same location with the project.

There is a checking statement to figure out if header guards exist and follow a naming convention. If there's
no header file included or the name of header guard is not the same as the one written on the statement,
it generates comilation error with a message.

There are two global variables named g_taxrate and g_discount. They are declared externally, so they can be
used externally in other modules. Because they are declared externally in RideRequest.h, the main module
is able to define them along with days.

Unlike the external linkage, the counter variable in display function is internal. it is a local-to-function variable which
has the lifetime of the program. Static keyword is difined when it was declared, it isn't gone even when out of scope.

In part 2, some elements of RideRequest module was edited to accept a ride description in the form of a C-style null-
terminated string of any length. I changed the variable of ride description from char array to char pointer to allocate it
dynamic when read function is called. Since resource of object is copied in main function, I added copy constructor and 
copy assignment operator. At last, destructor was added to prevent any memory leaks.
