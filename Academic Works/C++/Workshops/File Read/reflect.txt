I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to 
complete my workshops and assignments.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What I learned from this workshop is Dynamic Memory and Passing by reference. Dynamic Memory is
needed to allocate the memory which is not static to variables. In w1p1, I allocated dynamic memory to
global structure Employee employees to get data from the file read. The size of the structure had to be
changed by the size changing by the result of other functions. Passing by reference was needed to modify
the original values of arguments, for example the arguments of read, load, and display function.

Out parameter is a parameter that is passed by address or reference. Read functions that were used
in this workshop part1 passed name, number, and salary by reference using out parameter. 
The arguments in strucuture Employee were passed to the functions and the out parameters of the
functions allow the origianl values of the arguments to be modified. The difference with in parameter
is that out parameter doesn't need to be initialized before being passed to the function as the function
will assign a value to it.

On the other hand, in parameter is a parameter that is passed by value. Unlike out parameter, the value 
of an argument passed as an in parameter can be modified within the function scope not globally. In 
parameter does not affect the original value out of the function.

I can't find any in parameters in this workshop. I only had functions which have no parameter or out parameter.
Functions that have parameters have ampersend or pointer in the parameters, which means passing by reference,
or address. Those allow to modify the original value in the arguments.
