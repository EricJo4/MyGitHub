I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided 
to complete my workshops and assignments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have learned how to create and overload constructor in this workshop4. In part 1, there are
three constructors(Canister(), Canister(a parameter), Canister(two parameters)).
The one which has no parameters is for setting default values of member variables in the class. 
Parameters in the constructors change the values of the member variables as calling the arguments.
To prevent memory leak, destructor, ~Canister() is defined. It has delete[] m_contentName in it to
deallocate dynamic memory.
There are three reference of the current object to pour a content in a canister into another canister.
Those functions are used for changing values of the current object by returning *this.

In workshop2, I spent time finding how the w4_tester.cpp works. It was not hard to find how the objects
are defined but hard to find how to read and print labels. In readLabel() function, I used cin.getline to limit
the number of characters to 70 on console. For printLabel(), I used for loops to print recursive characters,
which was a huge back and forth work. Other than mandatory functions, I added setFrame(const char*) and 
setContent(const char*) to set frame and content variables to the values of the argument. The two functions 
were helpful for creating definitions of mandatory functions tidier.
