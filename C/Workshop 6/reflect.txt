1. 'while' can be used when variables in the condition have been initialized while 'do while' does
not need the initialization. 'for' condition includes initialization, expression, and update other than
those two types of iteration.
In the code I made for the workshop6, I used 'for' loop for adding values in arrays. 'for' loop condition
has the 3 processes that I mentioned above, so it is easy to read and keep track of the number of the 
loop repetition.

2. I usually break down the code into several parts loop by loop and run them one by one. 
That way is easy to find syntactic errors because a few errors appear on the error list so it 
doesn't take a long time to fix all of them. 
A semantic error I make frequently is miscalculation when printing variables using placeholder.
Sometimes the placeholder is wrong, for example, using %d for a double variable, or wrong 
formulas. When errors occur, I go over the section with attention to fix them.

3. When matching my code with the submitter, I think of 3 questions in order.
	1) Is the error just about typos?
	2) Is it a syntactic error?
	3) Is it a semantic error?
Fixing step along with each question
1) - Overhaul whether there is an extra space, leading, trailing, or typos. If so, fix it.
2) - Judge the reason for the error whether it is generated by wrong data type, formula, 
or variable then, fix the error.
3) - Recheck the whole loops if there's something I have missed or built redundantly.
