1. Do you have any previous programming experience? if so, what language(s)?
if not, what are your initial thoughts about the C language and this course?

-I have an expericence of Python and R. Those programming languages were
simpler than C language. C needs more materials to print out texts in
the console. I think C is little bit harder than those languages.

2. Describe your understanding of the compiling process of turning a C text file into an executable program.

-First of all, loading stdio.h directory by #inlude <stdio.h> is needed. Int main() is the first function for running
the program. Printf() can be used in curly bracket to print out texts and semi colon(;) must be at the end of all
codes. If all codes done, return 0; must not be missed on the last line follwed by close curly bracket.

3. What do you hope to achieve in this course? Describe your goals and expectations.

- I hope to get acknowledment about C language as much as possible. To achieve that, I'm going to concentrate
on lecture and lab class of this course. At the end of this course, I would not be afraid of any materials related to
computer.
